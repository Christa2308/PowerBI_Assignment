# Introduction 
We load the Uber Fares dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using Python to prepare it for analysis. A DataFrame provides a structured way to store and manipulate tabular data, making it easy to explore, clean the dataset and handle missing values.

We then perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain an initial understanding of the data. EDA helps identify the dataset's structure, dimensions, and variable types, and provides insight into the quality of the data by checking for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
